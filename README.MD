I found a puzzle online and I tried to practice my python skills.
My code is really bad, but I didn't want to work more than half an hour on it.

The riddle is:

"""
Could you find my PIN?
Take those hints:
    1. 9285 => "One number is correct, but in wrong position"
    2. 1937 => "Two numbers are correct, but in wrong positions"
    3. 5201 => "One number is correct and in correct position"
    4. 6507 => "No number is correct"
    5. 8524 => "Two numbers are correct, but in wrong position"
"""
